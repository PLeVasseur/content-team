## Mission

We create publishable content for the Rust Project from interviews to share with the entire Rust community. If you'd like a deep dive on our mission, see [here](./TEAM-MISSION.md).

Are you interested in being interviewed? Something interesting to share?
Please see [Interview contact](#interview-contact) below.

## Content produced

You can find a listing of content produced [here](./content/content-listing.md).
