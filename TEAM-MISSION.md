# Team Mission

Publishing more attractive content (e.g. blog posts, podcasts, videos, etc.) than we do today would be of benefit to the Project. Here are some reasons worth highlighting.

One, done well, this content has intrinsic value. By exploring and publishing more of what's happening in the Project, we inform both our community and other Project members. By talking with experts within the Project about their specialties and publishing the results, we share knowledge within the Project and help attract more people to the Project itself. By talking with our community -- e.g. uncovering the many sometimes surprising ways that people use Rust -- and publishing what we find, we circulate domain and industry-specific know-how, help our community to feel more engaged with the Project, deliver details and "texture" that inform our zeitgeist and priorities, and help teams to make better decisions.

Two -- again done well -- this content is good "marketing" for the Project. Does Rust need marketing? Yes. We're not yet helping everyone that we could help, and we're not yet attracting into our fold all of the talented people who could help us within the Project. Putting out high quality content helps us to achieve these ends.

Three, the value of published content has a recursive quality. E.g., if we do a podcast with an engineer in some special field about that person's work and the person's experience with and needs of our Project, that person will feel heard by us. That happens when we record it. Upon publication, though, maybe 100 or 1,0000 or more similarly-situated individuals might also hear that, and they too will feel heard. They'll say to themselves, "yes, that's exactly what needed to be said, and I'm glad the Rust Project is listening." I.e., it's important not just that we know something, but that people know that we know that thing.

Four, publishing attractive content helps to attract others to help us produce attractive content. Producing this content takes work, and we'll need a lot of help from capable people. Fortunately, putting out this kind of content can help us attract like-minded others interested in this work.

Five, the more attractive content that we publish, the more people will look to us for content. This gives us a bigger megaphone, and that helps us to achieve objectives such as e.g. attracting important stakeholders to our various initiatives and filling our conferences with interesting people.
